## 🎯 Key Features

- ✅ Responsive layout for all devices  
- ✅ Fixed navigation bar with hover effects  
- ✅ Collapsible mobile menu  
- ✅ Sectioned content with headings, images, and descriptions  
- ✅ Contact form layout (non-functional)  
- ✅ Styled footer with links and consistent layout
- 
## 📱 Responsive Design

The site is built to adapt across various screen sizes using media queries:
- On smaller devices, the navbar collapses into a menu icon.
- Images and text content resize fluidly.
- The footer always spans 100% width and sticks to the bottom.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Download or clone the repository  
2. Place all files in the same directory  
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser  
4. Navigate through the sections using the navigation bar  

## 📌 Notes

- The contact form is **static only** – it doesn't send emails. You can integrate services like **Formspree**, **Netlify Forms**, or **Google Forms** to make it functional.
- You can add your own images in the `<img>` tags provided inside the HTML files.
- All pages share a common stylesheet `style.css`, so style changes will reflect across the entire site.
